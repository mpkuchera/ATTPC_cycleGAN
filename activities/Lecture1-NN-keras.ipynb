Each event is therefore represented by 80 numbers.\n",

        "This difference in performance, especially with the sigmoid function, is known as the vanishing gradient problem. If the value for any one the neurons gets too far away from 0, the gradient for sigmoid and tanh gets really close to 0. This means that for deeper networks it is much more difficult to update the weights in the earlier layers as their gradient is so small. Now, remove the fifth column from the input data, the charge, and see what happens when training. Why do you think including charge has such a large impact?"
